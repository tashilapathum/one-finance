Download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tantalum.onefinance)

This is one of the oldest apps I've developed years ago back when I was starting Android development. I decided to make this open source despite being absolutely plagued with bad code, so someone could at least use this as an example for bad coding practices. Here are some
of the issues:
- Sphegatti code
- Redundant methods
- Duplicate classes and layouts
- Lack of use of constants
- Lack of basic concepts such as inheritance and encapsulation
- Multiple databases instead of tables
- String concatenation
- An unhealthy amount of third party libraries

Let me know if I missed anything.

Feel free to open a pull request if you decided fix this unholy code.

Godspeed.
